# GCATPy: A Python Package for Crash Data Retrieval and Analysis
A Package for Retrieving and Analyzing Crash Data from The Ohio Department of Transportation Crash Database

## GIS Crash Analysis Tool
The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT)'s GIS Crash Analysis Tool (GCAT) is a Transportation Information Mapping System (TIMS) application that uses GIS to analyze crash data, and the data dictionary can be found on the ODOT website. The purpose of GCAT is to provide a convenient highway safety crash analysis tool for ODOT, MPOs, city/county engineers, law enforcement agencies, and pre-qualified safety study consultants. The crash data provided on GCAT is not official and has been provided by the Ohio Department of Public Safety and modified by ODOT for engineering and analysis purposes ONLY. Original crash data reports can be obtained from the law enforcement agency handling the crash or Public Safety's Ohio Traffic Safety Office Crash Data site.

## GCATPY
GCATPy is a Python package designed for retrieving, processing, and analyzing crash data from the Ohio Department of Transportation's (ODOT) GIS Crash Analysis Tool (GCAT). It provides automated data retrieval, GIS integration, and customizable query options, allowing users to filter crashes by location, severity, and contributing factors. Built for transportation engineers, city planners, and law enforcement agencies, GCATPy enables data-driven decision-making by offering statistical analysis tools to identify crash trends, hazardous locations, and safety improvement opportunities. With export capabilities supporting multiple formats (CSV, GeoJSON, Shapefile), GCATPy streamlines crash data analysis for research, planning, and policy development.
